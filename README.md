# Customer Churn & Attrition: Analysis and Prediction
The Telco Churn Analysis and Modeling project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By integrating ETL, interactive dashboards, and machine learning, this end-to-end analytics system uncovers key customer insights, enabling data-driven retention strategies and proactive decision-making.

## ðŸ“ŒIntroduction: 
Customers are the asserts for every business. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical challenge for businesses across various industries, including telecommunications, banking, retail, and subscription-based services. Churn occurs when customers discontinue their association with a company, leading to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. Analysing and predicting churn is essential to understand the reasons behind customer departures and implement strategies to retain them. Acquiring a new customer is economically expensive and critical than retaining existing old customers. In the telecom industry, where competition is intense, churn prediction helps identify at-risk customers by analysing factors such as usage patterns, billing issues, service quality, and customer interactions. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, companies can proactively address customer concerns, offer personalized incentives, and improve overall satisfaction, ultimately enhancing customer retention and business sustainability.

## ðŸŽ¯Project Goal: ETL, Power BI & Machine Learning for Customer Churn Analysis
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive ETL process within a database, create an interactive Power BI dashboard, and build a predictive machine learning model to analyze and forecast customer churn. This initiative aims to provide deeper insights into customer behavior across multiple dimensions, including demographics, geographic distribution, payment and account details, and service usage patterns.

By studying the characteristics of churned customers, we can identify key factors influencing customer attrition and pinpoint areas where targeted marketing campaigns can be implemented to improve retention. Additionally, leveraging predictive analytics, the project seeks to establish a reliable method for forecasting potential churners, enabling proactive intervention strategies to enhance customer loyalty and business growth.

- False Positives (FP): 198 (Incorrectly predicted class 1 when it was actually 0)
- False Negatives (FN): 354 (Incorrectly predicted class 0 when it was actually 1)
- True Positives (TP): 1188 (Correctly predicted class 1)

**Classification Report:**
- High accuracy (0.89).
- High precision for both classes (0.94 for 0, 0.77 for 1).
- High recall for class 0 (0.90), good recall for class 1 (0.86).
- High F1-scores for both classes (0.92 for 0, 0.81 for 1).
** Model learned the training data very well.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Test Data Analysis:**

**Confusion Matrix:**

- True Negatives (TN): 753 (Correctly predicted class 0)
- False Positives (FP): 73 (Incorrectly predicted class 1 when it was actually 0)
- False Negatives (FN): 103 (Incorrectly predicted class 0 when it was actually 1)
- True Positives (TP): 273 (Correctly predicted class 1)

**Classification Report:**

- Good accuracy (0.86), slightly lower than training.
- Reasonable precision for both classes (0.91 for 0, 0.73 for 1).
- Reasonable recall for both class 0 (0.88) and class 1 (0.79).
- F1-score for class 0 (0.90) is good, but lower for class 1 (0.76).
**Performance is slightly lower on unseen data, especially for correctly identifying class 1.**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Final Conclusion:**

> The model performs well overall, achieving a good accuracy on the unseen test data. However, there is a noticeable drop in performance compared to the training data, suggesting a slight degree of overfitting. The model is particularly better at identifying instances of class 0 compared to class 1, as indicated by the lower recall and F1-score for class 1 on the test set. This may be because the data is imbalanced {Customer_Status : Stayed > 2(churned)} This the class 0 is influencing the model performance since it is the majority class. To resolved use Oversampling technique like SMOTE to enhance performance of model in classifying class 0 better.

## ðŸ’¡INSIGHTS From Predicted_Churn Data
> LINK:<a href="">Prediction Analysis Dashboard</a>
- The >50 age group had the highest count of predicted churners at 138, which was 1,050% heigher than the <20 age group with only 12 customers.
- The predicted churn distribution among age groups follows this order: **>50 (138)** > **35-50 (127)** > **20-35 (104)** > **<20 (12)**.
- Customers aged >50 make up 36.22% of all predicted churners, indicating a significant churn risk in this age category.
- The number of predicted churners varied across 22 states, with the highest count observed in **Uttar Pradesh (44 customers)** and the lowest count at 2 customers in the least affected states.
### ðŸš€Recommendations:
1) **Targeted Retention for Older Customers (>50) â€“** Offer personalized plans, better support, and loyalty benefits to reduce churn.
2) **Region-Specific Interventions â€“** Focus on high-churn states like Uttar Pradesh with localized service improvements and promotions.
3) **Engage At-Risk Age Groups â€“** Design retention campaigns for 35-50 age group as they also show high churn risk.
4) **Improve Customer Experience â€“** Address pain points leading to dissatisfaction, especially for older customers.
5) **Customized Offers for High-Risk Customers â€“** Provide discounts, extended contracts, or added benefits for month-to-month contract holders to encourage long-term commitment.

## CONCLUSION:
This project successfully integrates ETL, Power BI, and Machine Learning to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The insights from data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling highlight key churn drivers such as contract type, competitor influence, and customer demographics. The Random Forest model demonstrated strong predictive performance, though improvements like SMOTE for class balancing could enhance its ability to detect churners. Strategic recommendations, including targeted retention plans for high-risk segments and incentives for long-term contracts, can help reduce churn. By leveraging data-driven decision-making, telecom companies can enhance customer satisfaction, improve retention, and drive long-term business growth.
